Minimal Viable Product Notes:

Added Functionalities:
- Added a collider system...not sure I did it properly - added observers to the collision handler and if something collides it lets the collider know

Changes:
- Collapsed everything into one file because I poorly set up my projects also it cut my project size by nearly half.
- Moved all unit stats to a stats system allowing for customizable units so I can upgrade stats
- Removed unit checks from my A* algorithm - caused some issues - however it caused a lot less issues to go this route than the lag I was hitting because of it.
- Offensive ally units added for combat
- Implemented Settings and added the possibility for multiple control types - still tied to mouse and keyboard for now.

Bugs:
- Since A* doesn't find a way around units they often just catch on each other
- Balistas don't cost anything
- For some reason attack commands...when I get some more time I need to look into this
- Memory stacking issue - not entirely sure where from I think that serializers are holding onto memory from what I can see....there are probably other issues though that I need to find(Would recomend for now restarting the project and starting over instead of clicking play) - not overly bad as long as you don't spam but just a heads up.

Features to add:
- Add a tutorial scene to introduce the player to the game
- Abstract stuff back - probably won't get to this
- Clean up some code
- Maybe redo some of my systems
- Add more units
- Balance changes to make the game more reasonable
- UI updates to make things look more understandable - like queued things being visable and possibly more details on units

Controls:
Command(Default) - example 
Select(left click) - to Select units or Building Clicking and dragging your mouse then releasing selects multiple units - Also used for placing things
Interact(right click) - Selected units are sent to interact where you click - this includes moving
Zoom in(Scroll Up) - Scrolls into the screen
Zoom out(Scroll Down) - Scrolls out
Deselect(Escape) - Deselects the selected building
Up/Down/Left/Right(W/S/A/D)- Move the camera 

Note:
I used Json.Net so if there is a missing dependency it's probably this
