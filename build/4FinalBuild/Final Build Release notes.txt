Final Notes:

Features Added:
- Added an updating panel so the unit UI details is kept up to date
- Win/Loss page
Changes:
- Just refresh the world instead of creating a new instance of the game in an attempt to fix memory issues(in case it was holding on to another instance of the game)
- Kept ahold of the components instead of loading a new menu
- Added UI to show when the user clicks, as well as tool tips to give an idea of what you can do with the target.
- Fixed a garrison bug with move where the unit wasn't leaving garrison after you moved it.(Added the reset unit function to the move function)
- Capped Training to 10 to create a cleaner UI for the traning display
- Decorator for Components
  - Stat component - used to save stats for units
- Made mobs only follow a moving unit if the distance is ten tiles in an attempt to make the game less laggy when lots of hostile mobs spawn.
Things I did not get to:
- Number tweaks to make the game more balanced
- Cross platform support
- Multiplayer
- Saving the game
- Some sort of tutorial
- Dequeuing training units

Bugs:
- Units don't always go to the ideal space and sometimes walk under/into tiles causing them not to build/mine.
- Memory leak, traced it back to the world generation but couldn't figure out what was causing it to leak.
- Hopefully those are the only issues....large amounts of units haven't been tested yet....got this wrapped up late so did not get to limit test the game.

Controls:
- Check settings
