Some notes:
Everything stems from the the game1 file in the 0x46696E616C project

For the most part the outline of the game goes like this:
0x46696E616C:
A* implementation:
 * Anything related to my command components or the a* implementation

Mob Handler:
 * Template for mobs like a health bar and the interfaces
Tech Handler:
 * To be implemented - will hold all Upgrades for the world as a whole
UI Project:
 * All components not tied to command are put here
Util:
 * Holds the input manager and the camera - Quad is in here but it isn't getting used....was testing something
World Manager:
 * All concrete implementations of Buildings/Mobs are here - should figure out how to move the A* implementation out of 0x46696E616C to move unit    component here
 * All map handling/generation
 * All tiles are here
 * Content Handling is done here
 * World saving is done here - change over to a json save probably for tiles.
Known Bugs:
 * Units are extremely difficult to move off harvesting resources to go do something else.
Todo(By importance):
 * Implement combat units 
 * Implement Wave manager
 * Implement a better saving method
 * Implement description boxes for cost and details
 * Add group movement to not collide
 * Implement main menu
 * Figure out a way to go to the nearest point of the building
 * Clean up my file path
